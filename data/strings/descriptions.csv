old_hyperion,SHIP,"A supremely advanced design, fragile but with a superb power generator and the ability to mount more ordnance than any other mainstream frigate. Extremely expensive for its size.

Due to the perfectly modular design of the hull, power couplings and weapon slots, modifications of this ship class are not taxing on in flux shunts, plasma relays or the power core. In short, hull modifications are extremely easy to complete. It is often the case that a Theia-class is finely tuned with a cornucopia of mutually boosting hull modifications that make it even deadlier that a variant that is simply bristling with weapons. Naturally, such special modifications are not for the engineering novice and the uninitiated may just blow their entire fortune on a concept that seems good on paper, but is in fact useless in the battlespace. That is why there are many engineers that shun this modification-heavy approach and opt for a more weapon focused platform.

The end results of either approach usually affirm the apprehensive attitude Sector stellators have toward this ship.",,,
